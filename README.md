# Deep Learning for Time-Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables in Energy Consumption: A Performance and Interpretability Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and data for the paper titled "Deep Learning for Time-Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables in Energy Consumption: A Performance and Interpretability Analysis". The study investigates the efficacy of three deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Autoregressive (DeepAR), and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)—in predicting short-term energy consumption loads in smart grids. It explores how incorporating exogenous variables affects forecasting accuracy and examines model interpretability.
